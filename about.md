I'm Leigh-Anne. I'm a software developer based in London. I thought I would get started with some posts I wish were there when I was trying to search for them. 

If you've had enough of my site here, you can check out my 
[dark academic past](http://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/hd/m/Mathieson:Leigh=Anne.html)
or find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=102815278).


This page was made with [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com). Thanks [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo) for the positively painless Jekyll experience.
